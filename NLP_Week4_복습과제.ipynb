Before you begin, first run the following commands within the assignment directory in order to create the appropriate conda virtual environment. This guarantees that you have all the necessary packages to complete the assignment. Also note that you probably want to finish the previous math section before writing the code since you will be asked to implement the math functions in Python. You want to implement and test the following subsections in order since they are accumulative.\n",
