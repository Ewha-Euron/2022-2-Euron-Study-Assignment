"""# Convolutional Networks

So far we have worked with deep fully connected networks, using them to explore different optimization strategies and network architectures. Fully connected networks are a good testbed for experimentation because they are very computationally efficient, but in practice all state-of-the-art results use convolutional networks instead.

First you will implement several layer types that are used in convolutional networks. You will then use these layers to train a convolutional network on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

"""# Spatial Batch Normalization
We already saw that batch normalization is a very useful technique for training deep fully connected networks. As proposed in the original paper (link in `BatchNormalization.ipynb`), batch normalization can also be used for convolutional networks, but we need to tweak it a bit; the modification will be called "spatial batch normalization."

Normally, batch-normalization accepts inputs of shape `(N, D)` and produces outputs of shape `(N, D)`, where we normalize across the minibatch dimension `N`. For data coming from convolutional layers, batch normalization needs to accept inputs of shape `(N, C, H, W)` and produce outputs of shape `(N, C, H, W)` where the `N` dimension gives the minibatch size and the `(H, W)` dimensions give the spatial size of the feature map.

If the feature map was produced using convolutions, then we expect every feature channel's statistics e.g. mean, variance to be relatively consistent both between different images, and different locations within the same image -- after all, every feature channel is produced by the same convolutional filter! Therefore, spatial batch normalization computes a mean and variance for each of the `C` feature channels by computing statistics over the minibatch dimension `N` as well the spatial dimensions `H` and `W`.

"""# Spatial Group Normalization
In the previous notebook, we mentioned that Layer Normalization is an alternative normalization technique that mitigates the batch size limitations of Batch Normalization. However, as the authors of [2] observed, Layer Normalization does not perform as well as Batch Normalization when used with Convolutional Layers:

>With fully connected layers, all the hidden units in a layer tend to make similar contributions to the final prediction, and re-centering and rescaling the summed inputs to a layer works well. However, the assumption of similar contributions is no longer true for convolutional neural networks. The large number of the hidden units whose
receptive fields lie near the boundary of the image are rarely turned on and thus have very different
statistics from the rest of the hidden units within the same layer.

The authors of [3] propose an intermediary technique. In contrast to Layer Normalization, where you normalize over the entire feature per-datapoint, they suggest a consistent splitting of each per-datapoint feature into G groups and a per-group per-datapoint normalization instead.

<center>Visual comparison of the normalization techniques discussed so far (image edited from [3])</center>

Even though an assumption of equal contribution is still being made within each group, the authors hypothesize that this is not as problematic, as innate grouping arises within features for visual recognition. One example they use to illustrate this is that many high-performance handcrafted features in traditional computer vision have terms that are explicitly grouped together. Take for example Histogram of Oriented Gradients [4] -- after computing histograms per spatially local block, each per-block histogram is normalized before being concatenated together to form the final feature vector.

You will now implement Group Normalization.
