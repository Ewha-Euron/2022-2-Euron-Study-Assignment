"""# Batch Normalization
One way to make deep networks easier to train is to use more sophisticated optimization procedures such as SGD+momentum, RMSProp, or Adam. Another strategy is to change the architecture of the network to make it easier to train. One idea along these lines is batch normalization, proposed by [1] in 2015.

To understand the goal of batch normalization, it is important to first recognize that machine learning methods tend to perform better with input data consisting of uncorrelated features with zero mean and unit variance. When training a neural network, we can preprocess the data before feeding it to the network to explicitly decorrelate its features. This will ensure that the first layer of the network sees data that follows a nice distribution. However, even if we preprocess the input data, the activations at deeper layers of the network will likely no longer be decorrelated and will no longer have zero mean or unit variance, since they are output from earlier layers in the network. Even worse, during the training process the distribution of features at each layer of the network will shift as the weights of each layer are updated.

The authors of [1] hypothesize that the shifting distribution of features inside deep neural networks may make training deep networks more difficult. To overcome this problem, they propose to insert into the network layers that normalize batches. At training time, such a layer uses a minibatch of data to estimate the mean and standard deviation of each feature. These estimated means and standard deviations are then used to center and normalize the features of the minibatch. A running average of these means and standard deviations is kept during training, and at test time these running averages are used to center and normalize features.

It is possible that this normalization strategy could reduce the representational power of the network, since it may sometimes be optimal for certain layers to have features that are not zero-mean or unit variance. To this end, the batch normalization layer includes learnable shift and scale parameters for each feature dimension.

"""# Batch Normalization: Alternative Backward Pass
In class we talked about two different implementations for the sigmoid backward pass. One strategy is to write out a computation graph composed of simple operations and backprop through all intermediate values. Another strategy is to work out the derivatives on paper. For example, you can derive a very simple formula for the sigmoid function's backward pass by simplifying gradients on paper.

Surprisingly, it turns out that you can do a similar simplification for the batch normalization backward pass too!  

In the forward pass, given a set of inputs $X=\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\x_2\\...\\x_N\end{bmatrix}$, 

we first calculate the mean $\mu$ and variance $v$.
With $\mu$ and $v$ calculated, we can calculate the standard deviation $\sigma$  and normalized data $Y$.
The equations and graph illustration below describe the computation ($y_i$ is the i-th element of the vector $Y$).

\begin{align}
& \mu=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=1}^N x_k  &  v=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=1}^N (x_k-\mu)^2 \\
& \sigma=\sqrt{v+\epsilon}         &  y_i=\frac{x_i-\mu}{\sigma}
\end{align}

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cs231n/cs231n.github.io/master/assets/a2/batchnorm_graph.png">

The meat of our problem during backpropagation is to compute $\frac{\partial L}{\partial X}$, given the upstream gradient we receive, $\frac{\partial L}{\partial Y}.$ To do this, recall the chain rule in calculus gives us $\frac{\partial L}{\partial X} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial Y} \cdot \frac{\partial Y}{\partial X}$.

The unknown/hard part is $\frac{\partial Y}{\partial X}$. We can find this by first deriving step-by-step our local gradients at 
$\frac{\partial v}{\partial X}$, $\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial X}$,
$\frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial v}$, 
$\frac{\partial Y}{\partial \sigma}$, and $\frac{\partial Y}{\partial \mu}$,
and then use the chain rule to compose these gradients (which appear in the form of vectors!) appropriately to compute $\frac{\partial Y}{\partial X}$.

If it's challenging to directly reason about the gradients over $X$ and $Y$ which require matrix multiplication, try reasoning about the gradients in terms of individual elements $x_i$ and $y_i$ first: in that case, you will need to come up with the derivations for $\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i}$, by relying on the Chain Rule to first calculate the intermediate $\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial x_i}, \frac{\partial v}{\partial x_i}, \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial x_i},$ then assemble these pieces to calculate $\frac{\partial y_i}{\partial x_i}$. 

You should make sure each of the intermediary gradient derivations are all as simplified as possible, for ease of implementation. 

After doing so, implement the simplified batch normalization backward pass in the function `batchnorm_backward_alt` and compare the two implementations by running the following. Your two implementations should compute nearly identical results, but the alternative implementation should be a bit faster.

# Layer Normalization
Batch normalization has proved to be effective in making networks easier to train, but the dependency on batch size makes it less useful in complex networks which have a cap on the input batch size due to hardware limitations. 

Several alternatives to batch normalization have been proposed to mitigate this problem; one such technique is Layer Normalization [2]. Instead of normalizing over the batch, we normalize over the features. In other words, when using Layer Normalization, each feature vector corresponding to a single datapoint is normalized based on the sum of all terms within that feature vector.

## Inline Question 3:
Which of these data preprocessing steps is analogous to batch normalization, and which is analogous to layer normalization?

1. Scaling each image in the dataset, so that the RGB channels for each row of pixels within an image sums up to 1.
2. Scaling each image in the dataset, so that the RGB channels for all pixels within an image sums up to 1.  
3. Subtracting the mean image of the dataset from each image in the dataset.
4. Setting all RGB values to either 0 or 1 depending on a given threshold.

# Layer Normalization: Implementation

Now you'll implement layer normalization. This step should be relatively straightforward, as conceptually the implementation is almost identical to that of batch normalization. One significant difference though is that for layer normalization, we do not keep track of the moving moments, and the testing phase is identical to the training phase, where the mean and variance are directly calculated per datapoint.

Here's what you need to do:

* In `cs231n/layers.py`, implement the forward pass for layer normalization in the function `layernorm_forward`. 

Run the cell below to check your results.
* In `cs231n/layers.py`, implement the backward pass for layer normalization in the function `layernorm_backward`. 

Run the second cell below to check your results.
* Modify `cs231n/classifiers/fc_net.py` to add layer normalization to the `FullyConnectedNet`. When the `normalization` flag is set to `"layernorm"` in the constructor, you should insert a layer normalization layer before each ReLU nonlinearity. 

Run the third cell below to run the batch size experiment on layer normalization.
