*Complete and hand in this completed worksheet (including its outputs and any supporting code outside of the worksheet) with your assignment submission. For more details see the [assignments page](http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs231n/assignments.html) on the course website.*

We have seen that we can achieve reasonable performance on an image classification task by training a linear classifier on the pixels of the input image. In this exercise we will show that we can improve our classification performance by training linear classifiers not on raw pixels but on features that are computed from the raw pixels.

All of your work for this exercise will be done in this notebook.

"""## Extract Features
For each image we will compute a Histogram of Oriented
Gradients (HOG) as well as a color histogram using the hue channel in HSV
color space. We form our final feature vector for each image by concatenating
the HOG and color histogram feature vectors.

Roughly speaking, HOG should capture the texture of the image while ignoring
color information, and the color histogram represents the color of the input
image while ignoring texture. As a result, we expect that using both together
ought to work better than using either alone. Verifying this assumption would
be a good thing to try for your own interest.

The `hog_feature` and `color_histogram_hsv` functions both operate on a single
image and return a feature vector for that image. The extract_features
function takes a set of images and a list of feature functions and evaluates
each feature function on each image, storing the results in a matrix where
each column is the concatenation of all feature vectors for a single image.

## Neural Network on image features
Earlier in this assigment we saw that training a two-layer neural network on raw pixels achieved better classification performance than linear classifiers on raw pixels. In this notebook we have seen that linear classifiers on image features outperform linear classifiers on raw pixels. 

For completeness, we should also try training a neural network on image features. This approach should outperform all previous approaches: you should easily be able to achieve over 55% classification accuracy on the test set; our best model achieves about 60% classification accuracy.
