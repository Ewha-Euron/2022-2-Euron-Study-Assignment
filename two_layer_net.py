"""# Fully-Connected Neural Nets
In this exercise we will implement fully-connected networks using a modular approach. For each layer we will implement a `forward` and a `backward` function. The `forward` function will receive inputs, weights, and other parameters and will return both an output and a `cache` object storing data needed for the backward pass, like this:

```python
def layer_forward(x, w):
  ''' Receive inputs x and weights w '''
  # Do some computations ...
  z = # ... some intermediate value
  # Do some more computations ...
  out = # the output
   
  cache = (x, w, z, out) # Values we need to compute gradients
   
  return out, cache
```

The backward pass will receive upstream derivatives and the `cache` object, and will return gradients with respect to the inputs and weights, like this:

```python
def layer_backward(dout, cache):
  '''
  Receive dout (derivative of loss with respect to outputs) and cache,
  and compute derivative with respect to inputs.
  '''
  # Unpack cache values
  x, w, z, out = cache
  
  # Use values in cache to compute derivatives
  dx = # Derivative of loss with respect to x
  dw = # Derivative of loss with respect to w
  
  return dx, dw
```

After implementing a bunch of layers this way, we will be able to easily combine them to build classifiers with different architectures.

"""## Inline Question 1: 

We've only asked you to implement ReLU, but there are a number of different activation functions that one could use in neural networks, each with its pros and cons. In particular, an issue commonly seen with activation functions is getting zero (or close to zero) gradient flow during backpropagation. Which of the following activation functions have this problem? If you consider these functions in the one dimensional case, what types of input would lead to this behaviour?
1. Sigmoid
2. ReLU
3. Leaky ReLU

## Answer:
sigmoid, ReLU

# "Sandwich" layers
There are some common patterns of layers that are frequently used in neural nets. For example, affine layers are frequently followed by a ReLU nonlinearity. To make these common patterns easy, we define several convenience layers in the file `cs231n/layer_utils.py`.

For now take a look at the `affine_relu_forward` and `affine_relu_backward` functions, and run the following to numerically gradient check the backward pass:

"""# Tune your hyperparameters

**What's wrong?**. Looking at the visualizations above, we see that the loss is decreasing more or less linearly, which seems to suggest that the learning rate may be too low. Moreover, there is no gap between the training and validation accuracy, suggesting that the model we used has low capacity, and that we should increase its size. On the other hand, with a very large model we would expect to see more overfitting, which would manifest itself as a very large gap between the training and validation accuracy.

**Tuning**. Tuning the hyperparameters and developing intuition for how they affect the final performance is a large part of using Neural Networks, so we want you to get a lot of practice. Below, you should experiment with different values of the various hyperparameters, including hidden layer size, learning rate, numer of training epochs, and regularization strength. You might also consider tuning the learning rate decay, but you should be able to get good performance using the default value.

**Approximate results**. You should be aim to achieve a classification accuracy of greater than 48% on the validation set. Our best network gets over 52% on the validation set.

**Experiment**: You goal in this exercise is to get as good of a result on CIFAR-10 as you can (52% could serve as a reference), with a fully-connected Neural Network.
